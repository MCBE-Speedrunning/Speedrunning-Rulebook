* The use of glitches is required.
	- If you did not use glitches, submit to
	[Kill Bosses Glitchless](./bosses-glitchless.md).
	- Any glitches used must provide some sort of advantage, performing a
	visual bug that does not affect gameplay to submit your glitchless run
	to glitched is forbidden.
* Timing ends (on the frame) when the final boss entity fully disappears.
	- See the [timing rules](../global/README.md#timing-rules) regarding
	when timing begins.

correlate to which bosses you must kill.
