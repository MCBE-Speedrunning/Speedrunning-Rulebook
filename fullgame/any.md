# Any% Specific Rules

**If you have any questions, the answer may be in our
[FAQ](https://www.speedrun.com/mcbe/thread/vdv9t)**

[Back](../README.md)

* Beat the game as fast as possible with no in-game restrictions.
* The use of glitches is required.
	- If you did not use glitches, submit to
	[Any% Glitchless](any-glitchless.md).
	- Any glitches used must provide some sort of advantage; performing a
	visual bug that does not affect gameplay to submit your glitchless run
	to glitched is forbidden.
* Timing ends (on the frame) when the End Poem fades in upon exiting the End.
	- See the [timing rules](../global/README.md#timing-rules) regarding
	when timing begins.
