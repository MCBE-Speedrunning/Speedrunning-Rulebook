[Back](../README.md)


* You must show the achievements screen before (must have 0 achievements) and
after (show all attained achievements) the run.
* Timing ends when the requirement for the last achievement is completed, make
sure to write in the run description an approximate timestamp, so it's easier
for us to properly check whether the requirement has been met.
	- See the [timing rules](../global/README.md#timing-rules) regarding
	when timing begins.
* If you would rather see a list of achievements you must complete instead of
achievements you should not, see [here](hundo-achievements.md).
 * You are allowed to segment your run as long as you do not go in the world off recording/stream and you do not gain any achievements anywhere other than in the world on recording/stream. You are required to show the achievements at the start and at the end of every segment.
 * You must play on the version that the version splits are named after, for example for a 1.16 100% you can play on 1.16.0, 1.16.1, 1.16.100 etc (You cannot complete a 1.16 100% run on 1.19 by only completing the necessary achievements for 1.16).
