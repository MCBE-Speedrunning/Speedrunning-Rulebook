## Cheater Policy

* The Minecraft: Bedrock Edition community works on a very strict no-cheater
policy.
	- This stems from our rather lax proof rules, and the assumption that
	speedrunning is an inherently trust based competition.
* Minor infractions or general suspicion around a runner and/or run may result
in said runner being placed on our suspicious players list.
	- The implication is that runs from said runner will be studied in far
	more depth than the typical run.
	- The runner may also have additional restrictions placed upon them such
	as for example, the requirement to show all perspectives in cooperative
	runs.
* Serious offences will result in a permanent leaderboard ban, and the removal
of all previous runs.
* While we do not keep track of every speedrunner ever, if we do find that a
player has cheated in a game outside of Bedrock Edition, action will be taken.
	- Players caught cheating in a game outside of the Minecraft series are
	generally placed on the suspicious players list, but allowed to submit
	runs.
	- Players caught cheating in other games within the Minecraft series
	such as Java Edition and Legacy Edition will generally be banned from
	our leaderboards.

## Bannable Offences

The following offences may warrant a leaderboard ban

* Intentional fabrication of a run.
* The use of any sort of external program or cheat in order to gain an
advantage.
* Submission of runs set by other players under your own name.
* The use of alternate accounts on the leaderboards.
	- The alternate account will always be banned, however moderators serve
	the right to ban the players main account too.
