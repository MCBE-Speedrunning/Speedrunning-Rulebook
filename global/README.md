# Global Rules

**NOTE: The following rules may be overwritten by specific category rules**

**If you have any questions, the answer may be in our
[FAQ](https://www.speedrun.com/mcbe/thread/vdv9t)**
[Back](../README.md)

## General Rules

* The use of external tools that modify the game in any way, shape, or form are
forbidden.
* The as of now Android-exclusive 1.2.6.* duping glitch is banned from all
categories unless explicitely stated otherwise.
* In-game commands must not be executed during the run.
	- This includes glitch runs, where runners often attempt to use the
	command glitch. The command glitch is forbidden as it violates this
	rule.
* The editing of any world settings after world creation is strictly forbidden.
	- This includes changing gamemodes.
* Reloading the world (quitting and loading the same world again) always puts the run into the glitched category.
* While we do promote ingenuity and creativity from runners, do not attempt to
be cheeky in regards to the rules. Exploiting loopholes in the rules that were
clearly not intended to be exploited may result in your run being rejected.
	- If you do find a loophole, we ask you point it out to a moderator instead.

## Submission Rules

* Runners are permitted to run on any version of the game that they would like.
	- Certain Individual Level categories may require that you run on a
	specific version or range of versions.
	- Full game runs performed on beta versions of the game must be submit
	to the beta category on our category extensions.
	- Beta versions of the game are not permitted for individual level runs.
* If you submit a video significantly longer than the duration of the run,
specify timestamps of the runs beginning and end in the submission description.
	- This is not a required rule, however it is strongly recommend as it
	saves the moderators a lot of time when verifying.
	- If the queue is long enough your run may be rejected with a message
	requesting you resubmit with timestamps.
* Top runners must be prepared to send extra evidence for their runs, which may
include:
    - A full raw recording of the session
	- Recordings of past attempts
	- The world folder of the run (limited to PC runs)
	- The world seed (for random seed runs) - it is encouraged to send the
world seed for every submission, but not mandatory
* Other runners should also be ready to send this extra evidence if required
(though it will not be required in most cases)


## Game Modification Rules

* Any sort of texture pack or other visual modification that gives the runner an
advantage is banned.
	- [For an incomplete list check out the list of attributes that make a texture pack illegal](#texture-packs)
* All runs must be performed on a vanilla client.
	- There is an exception to this rule for runners playing on Linux.
* Runners are allowed to edit game options in the options.txt file of the game
	- This allows the changes of any visual settings (e.g. vsync to decrease lag)
	- Any changes that may be used to provide an advantage to the runner (e.g. gamma) are not allowed
* Any other form of game modification / data pack is forbidden.

## Proof Rules

* All runs require proof to be entered on the leaderboards.
	- By submitting to the leaderboards, you are giving the moderation team
	permission to download your run for retiming and archival purposes.
* Proof must be given in the form of a viewable video.
	- In the case of cooperative runs, only the host is required to provide
	proof.
	- Any video hosting service is allowed, and the video does not need to
	be public. It is however strongly recommend that you submit public
	videos on YouTube.
		+ If a video is not public, it must either be unlisted, or be
		shared with a moderator in another form.
	- There are no minimum quality settings, however at a minimum we
	recommend 480p video at 30fps.
	- A run may be rejected if there are too many dropped frames as it
	makes accurate retiming impossible.
	- Audio is not required.
* It is not required to have a timer.
* Editing the video in any way, shape, or form that affects the resulting time
of the run is strictly against the rules.
	- Examples of banned edits are splices and changing the video speed.
	- Examples of legal edits are putting music over your run and adding a
	custom video intro.
		+ You may use whatever music you would like.
* All videos must show the world creation process and the runner entering the
newly created world.

## Timing Rules

* Timing starts on the first frame of movement after world creation.
	- The pause menu and changing perspectives do
	not count as movement.
	- For cooperative runs, timing starts when the first player moves.
	- Opening your inventory, punching, and mining all count as movement.
* You may wait for a reasonable amount of time at the start of your run for the
world to load.
* Full game runs time with full second precision. Milliseconds will be used
however in the case of a tie.
* Individual level runs are timed with millisecond precision.

## World Creation Rules

**NOTE: All videos must display the world creation settings**

* Gamemode: Survival
* Difficulty: Easy, Normal, or Hard
	- Peaceful is allowed for peaceful specific categories.
* Starting Map: OFF
* Bonus Chest: OFF
* Default Player Permissions: Member
* World Type: Infinite
* Friendly Fire: ON
* Fire Spreads: ON
* TNT Explodes: ON
* Mob Loot: ON
* Tile Drops: ON
* Respawn Radius: Default
* Use Experimental Gameplay: OFF
* Activate Cheats: OFF

## Texture Packs

It is always a good idea to ask a moderator about a texture packs
validity as certain exceptions **may** be made. 

### Illegal Texture Packs

If a texture pack has any of the following it's a safe bet that it is illegal:

- Transparent inventory
- Fullbright
- X-Ray
- Outlined Ores (or other special blocks)
- Transparent water
- No Fog

### Legal Texture Packs

All official texture packs, such as Plastic or Natural texture packs, are allowed,
and so are any other texture packs that change the textures in a purely cosmetic 
way without giving an unfair advantage to the player.
