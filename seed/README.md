## Set Seed

* You must input the world seed manually.
	- It does not matter if you choose the seed, or randomly smash your
	keyboard. Submissions to set seed that do not predefine a seed will be
	rejected.
* Full game runs time with millisecond precision

## Random Seed

* You must leave the world seed box blank.
* Viewing the world seed before the end of the run is forbidden.

## Additional evidence

It is highly recommended to show the global resource packs settings page
before or after completing a run.
