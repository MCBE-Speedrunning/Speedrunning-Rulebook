## Set Seed

* You must input the world seed manually.
	- It does not matter if you choose the seed, or randomly smash your
	keyboard. Submissions to set seed that do not predefine a seed will be
	rejected.

## Random Seed

* You must leave the world seed box blank.
* Viewing the world seed before the end of the run is forbidden.
