	keyboard. Submissions to set seed that do not predefine a seed will be
	rejected.

## Random Seed

* You must leave the world seed box blank.
* Viewing the world seed before the end of the run is forbidden.
* The use of resource packs is forbidden.
    - For runs in the **top 5** of a **full game** category at the time
      of verification the resource packs tab must be shown before or
      after the run
    - For **world record** runs of an **individual level** category at
      the time of verification the resource packs tab must be shown
      before or after the run
