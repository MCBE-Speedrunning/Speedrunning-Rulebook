**NOTE: The following rules may be overwritten by specific category rules**

**If you have any questions, the answer may be in our [FAQ](https://www.speedrun.com/mcbe/thread/vdv9t)**

[Back](../README.md)

## General Rules

* The use of external tools that modify the game in any way, shape, or form are forbidden.
* In-game commands must not be executed during the run.
	- This includes glitch runs, where runners often attempt to use the command glitch. The command glitch is forbidden as it violates this rule.
* The editing of any world settings after world creation is strictly forbidden.
	- This includes changing gamemodes.
* While we do promote ingenuity and creativity from runners, do not attempt to be cheeky in regards to the rules. Exploiting loopholes in the rules that were clearly not intended to be exploited may result in your run being rejected.
	- If you do find a loophole, we ask you point it out to a moderator instead.

## Submission Rules

* Runners are permitted to run on any version of the game that they would like.
	- Certain Individual Level categories may require that you run on a specific version or range of versions.
	- Full game runs performed on beta versions of the game must be submit to the beta category on our category extensions.
	- Beta versions of the game are not permitted for individual level runs.
* If you submit a video significantly longer than the duration of the run, specify timestamps of the runs beginning and end in the submission description.
	- This is not a required rule, however it is strongly recommend as it saves the moderators a lot of time when verifying.
	- If the queue is long enough your run may be rejected with a message requesting you resubmit with timestamps.
	
## Game Modification Rules

* Any sort of texture pack or other visual modification that gives the runner an advantage is banned.
	- An example of an illegal texture pack is an x-ray texture pack, or a texture pack that outlines/highlights important blocks.
	- An example of a legal texture pack is one that gives you higher quality textures.
	- It is always a good idea to ask a moderator about a texture packs validity as certain exceptions **may** be made. For example, an ore outlining texture pack **may** be allowed in a set seed run, where it is assumed the runner knows the ore locations by heart.
* All runs must be performed on a vanilla client.
	- There is an exception to this rule for runners playing on Linux.
* Any other form of game modification / data pack is forbidden.

## Proof Rules

* All runs require proof to be entered on the leaderboards.
	- By submitting to the leaderboards, you are giving the moderation team permission to download your run for retiming and archival purposes.
* Proof must be given in the form of a viewable video.
	- In the case of cooperative runs, only the host is required to provide proof.
	- Any video hosting service is allowed, and the video does not need to be public. It is however strongly recommend that you submit public videos on YouTube.
	- There are no minimum quality settings, however at a minimum we recommend 480p video at 30fps.
	- A run may be rejected if there are too many dropped frames as it makes accurate retiming impossible.
* It is not required to have a timer.
* Editing the video in any way, shape, or form that affects the resulting time of the run is strictly against the rules.
	- Examples of banned edits are splices and changing the video speed.
	- Examples of legal edits are putting music over your run and adding a custom video intro.
		+ You may use whatever music you would like.
* All videos must show the world creation process and the runner entering the newly created world.

## Timing Rules

* Timing starts on the first frame of movement after world creation.
	- Opening your inventory, the pause menu, and changing perspectives do not count as movement.
	- For cooperative runs, timing starts when the first player moves.
* You may wait for a reasonable amount of time at the start of your run for the world to load.
* Full game runs time with full second precision. Milliseconds will be used however in the case of a tie.
* Individual level runs are timed with millisecond precision.
